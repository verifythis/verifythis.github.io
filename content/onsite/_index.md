# VerifyThis Competition

2025 edition at ETAPS 2025 in Hamilton, Canada - consider the Participation link below!

## About

VerifyThis is a series of program verification competitions, which has
taken place annually since 2011 (with the exception of 2020). Previous
competitions in the series have been held at FoVeOOS 2011, FM 2012,
Dagstuhl (April 2014), and ETAPS 2015--2024. The challenge problems
and solutions of previous competitions are available in the
[archive](archive).

The aims of the competition are:

- to bring together those interested in formal verification, and to
  provide an engaging, hands-on, and fun opportunity for discussion.
- to evaluate the usability of program verification techniques and
  tools.

The competition will offer a number of challenges presented in natural
language and pseudo code. Participants have to formalize the
requirements, implement a solution, and formally verify the
implementation for adherence to the specification.

There are no restrictions on the programming language and verification
technology used. The correctness properties posed in problems will
have the input-output behavior of programs in focus. Solutions will be
judged for correctness, completeness, and elegance.

**The use of AI-based tools is allowed; solutions to challenges need to mention which AI tools were used, if any.**

## Related Events and Activities

More-recently, there have also been VerifyThis Long-Term Challenges
designed for informal comparison and collaborations over several months:
see [https://verifythis.github.io/](https://verifythis.github.io/) for details.

Related events also include the Verified Software Competition (VSComp: [http://sites.google.com/a/vscomp.org/main/](http://sites.google.com/a/vscomp.org/main/), [https://sites.google.com/site/vstte2012/compet](https://sites.google.com/site/vstte2012/compet), [http://www.vscomp.org](http://www.vscomp.org/)) held online and the
Competition on Software Verification](http://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org/)
focusing on evaluating systems in a way that does not require user
interaction. SV-COMP is associated with TACAS.


VerifyThis is also a collection of verification problems (and
solutions). Its counterpart is
[VerifyThus](http://verifythus.cost-ic0701.org/)---a distribution of
deductive verification tools for Java-like languages, bundled and
ready to run in a VM. Both were created with support from [COST Action
IC0701](http://verifythus.cost-ic0701.org/).

A workshop on comparative empirical evaluation of reasoning systems
[COMPARE2012](http://compare2012.verifythis.org/) was held on June
30th at IJCAR 2012 in Manchester. Competitions were one of the main
topics of the workshop.
