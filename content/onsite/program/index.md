## Sunday

We encourage all teams to use the workshop room and present and compare
their solutions - we will organise an informal schedule (and the coffee
breaks and lunch are included). We will arrange a timetable for each
team to meet with the judges in parallel throughout the day. Please aim
to be available from 9am to 6pm and let us know of hard constraints
otherwise.
