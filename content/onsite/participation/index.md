### Participation at VerifyThis 2026

Participation is open for anybody interested. Teams of up to two people are allowed. VerifyThis will be held as a hybrid workshop as part of ETAPS 2026 in Turino, Italy. 

Registration for physical attendance of ETAPS workshops is required. To register as a physical attendee, use the [registration page of ETAPS'2026](https://etaps.org/2026/registration/) and register for both Saturday and Sunday. The actual competition will happen on the first day, whereas the second day will be used to discuss and evaluate the solutions. To register as a virtual attendee, please complete the [registration form](https://forms.gle/HzDHWzuhERGw2WaZ8). More details and a full program will be announced [here on the website](../program/).

We particularly encourage participation of:

- student teams (this includes PhD students)
- non-developer teams / using a tool someone else developed
- several teams using the same tool


### Travel Grants

The competition has funds for a limited number of travel grants. A grant
covers the incurred travel and accommodation costs up to a certain
limit. The currently-expected limit is EUR 400 for those coming from
Europe and EUR 700 for those coming from outside Europe.

We are particularly keen to increase diversity (in all senses) at the
competition, and may take this into account if needing to prioritise
travel grants; regardless, we strongly encourage you to apply if you
have a need.

Please submit your application to [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSerenw56tJTNQwMoB8MQrqeMDxriiVxWmO7SIokxHTD-Dk2Dg/viewform) by March 3rd.
