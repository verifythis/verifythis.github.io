[Lukas Grätz](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/se/gruppenmitglieder/groupmembers_detailseite_96960.de.jsp)
will present his work on a generalisation of the concept of program
contracts.

**Time and Date:** *25 June 2025, 16:00 CEST*,

As a follow-up to the March 2024 [Lorentz Center workshop on Contract
Languages](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/contract-languages.html), we
will host a series of online presentations and discussions around
formal methods with contract languages, aligning with the LTC goal of
enabling information exchange between different formal systems.

#### Title

Dependent Assertion Logic for Modular Software Veriﬁcation

#### Abstract

Abstract. Software is often not designed for formal specification using
method contracts (without source refactoring). As solution, we propose
dependent assertions, a generalization of method contracts. Our formal-
ization uses the propositional dynamic logic PDL but with Dijkstra’s
dynamic indices instead of programs inside modal operators. For deduc-
tive verification based on a new symbolic execution approach, we outline
a sequent calculus to prove basic dependent assertions, including loop
invariants. Finally, we can use any (D)PDL solver to prove modular
contracts from basic dependencies and other contracts.
